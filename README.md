# R Project


To run this project, the latest version of RStudio should be used. This project explores basic exploratory data analysis (EDA - numeric summaries and graphs), data transformations, and then some linear regression models. It uses the different packages in tidyverse to read in, manipulate, and graph the data set. For more details, see the project!
