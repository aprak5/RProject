# R Project

In this project, we will read in a data set, do some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA - numeric summaries and graphs), data transformations, and then fit some linear regression models. We will use the different packages in tidyverse to read in, manipulate, and graph the data set. For more details, see the project!
